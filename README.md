## Download/Installation

You can download a version in the [releases page](https://github.com/Synthird/File-reader/releases).

### Opening the exe in the zip folder (Windows only)

1. Download and unzip the zip folder called "File-reader.zip"
3. Open the exe file
4. If you get a pop-up saying the exe might be a virus
    - Click "More info"

This is not a virus, so it is safe to install.
